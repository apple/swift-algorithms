For benchmarking of particular algorithms, please use the 
`algorithms-benchmark` executable target. For convenience, this target 
already imports `Algorithms`.

Example usage:

`$ swift run -c release algorithms-benchmark run <name-of-results-file> --cycles 5`

`$ swift run -c release algorithms-benchmark render <name-of-results-file> <name-of-chart-file>.png`
