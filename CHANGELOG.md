# CHANGELOG

<!-- 
Add new items at the end of the relevant section under **Unreleased**.

This project follows semantic versioning. While still in major version `0`,
source-stability is only guaranteed within minor versions (e.g. between
`0.0.3` and `0.0.4`). If you want to guard against potentially source-breaking
package updates, you can specify your package dependency using
`.upToNextMinor(from: "0.0.1")` as the requirement.

*No changes yet.*

## [0.0.4] - 2021-03-29

### Additions

More new algorithms to join the party:

- A lazy version of the standard library's two `split` methods. ([#78])
- `firstNonNil(_:)` returns the first non-`nil` element from an
  optional-generating transform. ([#31])
- `uniquePermutations()` skips duplicates when generating permutations of a
  collection. ([#91])
- The `reductions` methods return all the in-between states of reducing a
  sequence or collection. ([#46])

### Fixes

- Methods and computed properties are more consistently marked as inlinable, 
  resolving a performance regression. 
- The `Stride` type now efficiently calculates distances between positions,
  supported by the underlying collection.
- Better test coverage and improved diagnostics for comparing sequences.
- Fixed links and improved documentation.

The 0.0.4 release includes contributions from [bjhomer], [danielctull],
[hashemi], [karwa], [kylemacomber], [LucianoPAlmeida], [mdznr], [natecook1000],
[ollieatkinson], [Qata], [timvermeulen], and [toddthomas]. Thank you!

## [0.0.3] - 2021-02-26

### Additions

An exciting group of new algorithms, contributed by the community:

- `trimming(while:)` returns a subsequence of a bidirectional collection with
  the matching elements removed from the start and end. ([#4])
- `min(ofCount:)` and `max(ofCount:)` find the smallest or largest elements in 
  a collection. ([#9], [#77])
- `windows(ofCount:)` lets you iterate over all the overlapping subsequences of
  a particular length. ([#20])
- `striding(by:)` iterates over every *n*th element of a sequence or collection.
  ([#24])
- `interspersed(with:)` places a new element between every pair of elements in
  a sequence or collection. ([#35])
- `chunks(ofCount:)` breaks a collection into subsequences of the given number
  of elements. ([#54])
- `suffix(while:)` matches the standard library's `prefix(while:)`, by 
  returning the suffix of all matching elements from a bidirectional collection.
  ([#65])
- Variations of `combinations(ofCount:)` and `permutations(ofCount:)` that take
  a range expression as a parameter, returning combinations and permutations of
  multiple lengths. ([#51], [#56])

### Changes

- The `LazyChunked` type now precomputes its `startIndex`, making performance
  more predictable when using the collection. 

### Fixes

- `randomSample(count:)` no longer traps in rare circumstances.
- Index calculations have been improved in a variety of collection wrappers.
- A variety of documentation improvements and corrections.

The 0.0.3 release includes contributions from [benrimmington], [danielctull],
[dhruvshah8], [karwa], [LucianoPAlmeida], [markuswntr], [mdznr], [michiboo],
[natecook1000], [ollieatkinson], [rakaramos], [rockbruno], [Roshankumar350],
[sidepelican], and [timvermeulen]. Thank you!

## [0.0.2] - 2020-10-23

### Changes

- The `rotate(at:)` method has been updated to `rotate(toStartAt:)`, with the
  old name deprecated.
- The `chained(with:)` method has been changed to the free function
  `chain(_:_:)`, with the old version deprecated.
- `Algorithms` now uses `RealModule` from the `swift-numerics` package for its
  cross-platform elementary functions.
- Sequence/collection wrapper types, like `Permutations` and `Indexed`, now
  have conformance to the lazy protocols, so that any following operations
  maintain their laziness.

### Fixes

- `Algorithms` now builds under SwiftPM on Windows.
- A wide variety of errors, misspellings, and ommissions in the documentation
  and guides have been fixed. 
- Index/distance calculations for the `Product2` and `Chain` types have been
  corrected.
- Calling `stablePartition(subrange:by:)` now correctly uses the subrange's
  length instead of the whole collection.

The 0.0.2 release includes contributions from [AustinConlon], [egorzhdan],
[IanKeen], [iSame7], [karwa], [kylemacomber], [natecook1000], [nordicio],
[pmtao], [schlagelk], [stephentyrone], and [timvermeulen]. Thank you!
