# CHANGELOG

<!-- 
Add new items at the end of the relevant section under **Unreleased**.
-->

This project follows semantic versioning. While still in major version `0`,
source-stability is only guaranteed within minor versions (e.g. between
`0.0.3` and `0.0.4`). If you want to guard against potentially source-breaking
package updates, you can specify your package dependency using
`.upToNextMinor(from: "0.0.1")` as the requirement.

## [Unreleased]

### Additions

- The `sortedOverlap(with: by:)` and `sortedOverlap(with:)` methods have been
  added.  They report how much overlap two sorted sequences have, expressed by
  the new `Inclusion` type.

## [0.0.2] - 2020-10-23

### Changes

- The `rotate(at:)` method has been updated to `rotate(toStartAt:)`, with the
  old name deprecated.
- The `chained(with:)` method has been changed to the free function
  `chain(_:_:)`, with the old version deprecated.
- `Algorithms` now uses `RealModule` from the `swift-numerics` package for its
  cross-platform elementary functions.
- Sequence/collection wrapper types, like `Permutations` and `Indexed`, now
  have conformance to the lazy protocols, so that any following operations
  maintain their laziness.

### Fixes

- Swift Algorithms now builds under SwiftPM on Windows.
- A wide variety of errors, misspellings, and ommissions in the documentation
  and guides have been fixed. 
- Index/distance calculations for the `Product2` and `Chain` types have been
  corrected.
- Calling `stablePartition(subrange:by:)` now correctly uses the subrange's
  length instead of the whole collection.
