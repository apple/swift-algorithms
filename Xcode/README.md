#  Xcode build files

The project file here can be used to build a variant of this package with Xcode, producing a single framework bundle. Build settings are entirely configured via the provided xcconfig files.

Beware! The contents of this directory are not source stable. They are provided as is, with no compatibility promises across package releases. Future versions of this package can arbitrarily change these files or remove them, without any advance notice. (This can include patch releases.)
